# font-awesome-backgrounds
A stylesheet to be used with font awesome icons that allows you to customize the shape and look with just classes. 
For example if you wanted all of your icons to be circular with orange background and white font then you would apply the classes "circle" and "uniform". It's a work in progress. I created it for my current job and thought it'd be nice to share and let people add on to it. 


I don't provide the Font Awesome Icons CSS, you can download it at https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
